README:

A personal backup utility based on rsync and implemented using bash script.

This utility can perform incremental backup of your directory to some external
drive. The script has a provision to exclude undesired files and directories
via external file "backup-ignore", for example, .obj files, temporary and
intermediate files generated on your system.

Requirements:

- Cygwin is required on Windows
- rsync must be installed for this utility to work

Important Note:

This utility does not come with any warranty and should be used cautiously and
completely at your own risk.

Usage:

- Make sure the line endings of the 'backup' script is set to Unix(LF) mode.

- Make sure the 'backup' script has executable permission.
  $ chmod +x ./backup

- Place the 'backup' file at the same level of your working folder.

For e.g. if 'mydir' is your main working directory, 'backup' script should be placed
under 'user' directory as shown below:

   / [root]
   |
   +--[home]
       |
       +---[user]
            |
            +---[mydir]  -->  Folder to backup
            |
            +---backup   -->  backup script

- Edit the 'backup' script and configure basic variables as required.

    SRC_PATH(required):
    Points to the name of your source directory to backup, for e.g. "./mydir".

    BACKUP_ROOT:
    Root folder under destination drive where backup will be made(this folder
    will be created if required)

    LOG_FILE:
    Name of the log file generated.

- Create a file named "backup-ignore" at the same directory where the backup script
  is placed. Edit the file to specify all files / directories that must be excluded
  from backup as shown below, for example.

  *.obj
  *.class
  *.dex
  mydir/proj/build

- Connect your external hard drive and note its drive name or path.

- Goto directory where 'backup' script is installed.
    $ cd ~

- Now, run the backup utility.

    $ ./backup

- From the menu, select the destination drive where you want to backup and continue.
