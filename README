This utility can perform incremental backup of your directory to some external

backed-up, for e.g. .obj files, Visual Studio intermediate files etc.

completely at your own risk.

should be placed under 'users' folder as shown below:

       |
       +---[mydir]  -->  Folder to backup
       |
       +---backup   -->  backup script
