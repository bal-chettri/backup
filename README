README:

A personal backup utility based on rsync and implemented using bash script.

This utility can perform incremental backup of your directory to some external
drive. The backup script should be first configured as required by modifying
some basic variables. The script also a special provision to exclude some 
undesired files to be backed-up, for e.g. .obj files, Visual Studio intermediate 
files etc.

Requirements:

- Cygwin is required on Windows
- rsync must be installed for this utility to work

Important Note:

This utility should be used cautiously and completely at your risk. Do not blame 
anyone else, except yourself, if any of you data is damaged or lost.

Usage:

- Place the 'backup' file at the same level of your working folder.

- Make sure the line endings of the 'backup' script is set to Unix(LF) mode.

For e.g. if 'mydir' is your working folder under Windows, 'backup' script
should be placed under 'users' folder as shown below:

   D:\
   |
   +--[users]
       |
       +---[mydir]  -->  Folder to backup
       |
       +---backup   -->  backup script
       
- Connect your external hard drive and note its drive name.

- Open 'backup' script and configure the basic variables as required.

    DEST_DRIVE variable should correctly point to the path of your external 
    hard drive. For e.g. if your backup drive name is F: then you should
    change DEST_DRIVE to /cygdrive/f.

- Open Cygwin terminal and goto the directory where 'backup' script is placed.

- Make sure 'backup' has an executable permission.

    $ chmod +x backup
    
- Now, run the backup utility.

    $ ./backup
